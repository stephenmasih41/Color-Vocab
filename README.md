# 🎨 Spanish Vocabulary – Learn Colors in Spanish! 🇪🇸

👋 **Welcome to my Day 43 of the Python Bootcamp!**  
Although the focus of my bootcamp is Python, today’s project explores a bit of **HTML + CSS** to make learning Spanish colors both **fun** and **visual**. 🌈

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This mini-project is a simple web page that helps users learn **basic color vocabulary in Spanish**.  
Each color is displayed with:

- A **Spanish name** 🗣️
- A **matching color** 🎨
- An **image** showing that color 🖼️

It’s a quick and colorful way to connect **visual memory** with **language learning**.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Language / Tool        | Purpose                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 🧩 **HTML5**           | Structure of the webpage            |
| 🎨 **CSS3**            | Styling and coloring each element   |

## 🗂️ Project Files

```
📦 spanish-vocabulary
├── index.html      # Main HTML file
├── style.css       # Styling rules
└── assets/
    └── images/     # Contains color images (red, blue, orange, green, yellow)
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Each color name (like “Rojo” or “Azul”) is wrapped inside an `<h2>` tag with a unique `id`.
2. The **CSS** file assigns color values to each `id` (for example, `#red { color: red; }`).
3. Each `<img>` tag loads a color image from the `assets/images` folder.
4. The combination of **text color**, **word**, and **image** reinforces memory — perfect for learners! 🧩
